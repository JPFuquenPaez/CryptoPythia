## Introduction

This project focuses on time series forecasting using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional 1D (Conv1D) layers. Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains such as finance, weather prediction, and demand forecasting. The goal is to predict future values based on historical data.

## System Design

### Architecture Overview

The system is designed to fetch, preprocess, and engineer features from historical Bitcoin price data. It then trains a deep learning model using LSTM and Conv1D layers to forecast future prices. The model is registered and versioned using MLflow for easy deployment and monitoring.

### Components

1. **Data Fetching**: Fetches historical Bitcoin price data from the Binance API.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Calculates technical indicators, cyclical features, Fourier transforms, rolling means, and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).
4. **MLflow Integration**: Tracks experiments, manages models, and deploys models.
5. **Model Training**: Trains an LSTM-Conv1D model on the preprocessed data.
6. **Forecasting**: Uses the trained model to make predictions on new data.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
8. **Model Management**: Registers and versions the model using MLflow.

logging.info(f"Scaler registered: {scaler_result}")

# Register the model in the MLflow Model Registry
model_uri = f"runs:/{mlflow.active_run().info.run_id}/{model_name}"
model_result = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, model_name)
logging.info(f"Model registered: {model_result}")

# Transition the model version to "Staging"
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
client.transition_model_version_stage(name=model_name, version=model_result.version, stage="Staging")
logging.info(f"Model transitioned to Staging: {model_result.version}")

# Transition the scaler version to "Staging"
client.transition_model_version_stage(name=scaler_name, version=scaler_result.version, stage="Staging")
logging.info(f"Scaler transitioned to Staging: {scaler_result.version}")
```

- **Methodology**: Use MLflow's Model Registry to manage model versions and stages. This helps in deploying the best model version to production.
- **Best Practices**: Ensure that models are registered and transitioned through different stages (e.g., Staging, Production) based on their performance.

#### 3. Model Serving

**Functionality**: Deploy models for inference using MLflow's serving capabilities.

**Code**:
```python
# Load the best model and scaler for inference
model = mlflow.tensorflow.load_model(model_uri)
scaler = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(scaler_uri)

# Forecast future values until the specified target date
forecasted_values = forecast_future_values(model, scaler, data, n_timesteps, target_date, date_column)
```

- **Methodology**: Use MLflow to load registered models and scalers for inference. This ensures that the correct model version is used for predictions.
- **Best Practices**: Ensure that the model and scaler are correctly loaded and used for inference.

## Data Fetching

### Purpose
The first step in any machine learning project is to fetch the data. This involves collecting the raw data that will be used for training and testing the model.

### Steps
1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine where the data will come from. This could be databases, APIs, or publicly available datasets.
2. **Download Data**: Use appropriate tools or scripts to download the data. Ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily processed (e.g., CSV, JSON).

### Example
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv')
```

## Data Preprocessing

### Purpose
Data preprocessing is essential for cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for model training. This step ensures that the data is consistent, free of errors, and in the correct format.

### Steps
1. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset. This can be done by imputing missing values or removing rows/columns with missing data.
2. **Normalize Data**: Scale the data to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps in improving the convergence of the model during training.
3. **Split Data**: Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that the model can be evaluated on unseen data.

### Example
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Handle missing values
data = data.fillna(method='ffill')

# Normalize data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data_scaled[:, :-1], data_scaled[:, -1], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Feature Engineering

### Purpose
Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing data to improve the model's performance. This step is crucial for capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

### Steps
1. **Create Lag Features**: Generate lag features to capture the temporal dependencies in the time series data.
2. **Rolling Statistics**: Calculate rolling statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and moving averages to capture trends and seasonality.
3. **Fourier Transform**: Use Fourier transform to capture periodic patterns in the data.

### Example
```python
import numpy as np

# Create lag features
def create_lag_features(data, lags):
    for lag in lags:
        data[f'lag_{lag}'] = data['value'].shift(lag)
    return data

# Calculate rolling statistics
def calculate_rolling_statistics(data, window):
    data['rolling_mean'] = data['value'].rolling(window=window).mean()
    data['rolling_std'] = data['value'].rolling(window=window).std()
    return data

# Apply feature engineering
data = create_lag_features(data, lags=[1, 2, 3])
data = calculate_rolling_statistics(data, window=7)
```

## Model Training

### Purpose
Model training involves training the neural network on the preprocessed data. This step includes defining the model architecture, compiling the model, and fitting it to the training data.

### Steps
1. **Define Model Architecture**: Use a combination of Conv1D and LSTM layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in the data.
2. **Compile the Model**: Specify the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
3. **Train the Model**: Fit the model to the training data and validate its performance on the validation set.

### Example
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, LSTM, Dense

# Define the neural network architecture
n_timesteps = 100  # Example value for n_timesteps
X_train_shape_2 = 10  # Example value for X_train.shape[2]

lstm_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='linear', input_shape=(n_timesteps, X_train_shape_2)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Conv1D(filters=256, kernel_size=3, activation='linear'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Conv1D(filters=200, kernel_size=3, activation='linear'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    Conv1D(filters=150, kernel_size=3, activation='linear'),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    LSTM(100, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(30, activation='linear'),
    Dense(15, activation='linear'),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
lstm_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = lstm_model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                        epochs=20,
                        batch_size=64,
                        validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

### Theoretical Background
- **Conv1D Layer**: The Conv1D layer is used to capture spatial patterns in the time series data. It applies convolutional filters to the input data to extract features.
- **LSTM Layer**: The LSTM layer is used to capture temporal dependencies in the data. It is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies.

## Forecasting

### Purpose
Forecasting involves using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. This step is crucial for evaluating the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

### Steps
1. **Preprocess New Data**: Apply the same preprocessing steps to the new data as were applied to the training data.
2. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the new data.
3. **Post-process Predictions**: Convert the predictions back to the original scale if necessary.

### Example
```python
# Preprocess new data
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = lstm_model.predict(new_data_scaled)

# Post-process predictions
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Purpose
Evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the model. They provide a quantitative measure of how well the model is performing.

### Metrics
1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errorsâthat is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the average of squared errors. It is more interpretable than MSE because it is in the same units as the target variable.
3. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

### Example
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

# Calculate evaluation metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)

print(f'MSE: {mse}')
print(f'RMSE: {rmse}')
print(f'MAE: {mae}')
```
